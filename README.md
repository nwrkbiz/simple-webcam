-----------

### Application

The optional "--device" parameter can be used to specify the camara device (defaults to 0). Pressing the 's' key allows taking snapshots which are stored in the same directory as the executable.

All provided executables are completely statically linked and thus should be able to run on any device running Linux/Windows.
